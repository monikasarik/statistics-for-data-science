ðŸ“Š Statistics for Data Science â€“ Learning Journey
Welcome to my Statistics for Data Science repository! This is a personal learning space where I document key concepts, examples, and notes as I build my foundation in statisticsâ€”one of the most essential pillars of data science.

ðŸ“Œ What is Statistics?
Statistics is the science of learning from data. It involves:
Collecting
Organizing
Analyzing
Interpreting
Presenting data
In simple terms, statistics helps us transform raw data into meaningful insightsâ€”a core skill in any data-driven field.

ðŸŽ¯ Why is Statistics Important in Data Science?
In the world of data science, statistics empowers us to:
Understand distributions and relationships in data
Make informed, evidence-based decisions
Validate assumptions and test hypotheses
Model uncertainty and make predictions
Evaluate the performance of machine learning models

ðŸ“š Types of Statistics
1. Descriptive Statistics â€“ Whatâ€™s happening in the data?
Summarizes data using numerical and graphical methods
Common metrics: mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation
Tools: histograms, boxplots, bar charts

2. Inferential Statistics â€“ What can we infer about the population?
Draws conclusions and makes predictions based on sample data
Key concepts: sampling, confidence intervals, p-values, hypothesis testing, regression

âœ… Real-World Example
Imagine analyzing customer churn:
Descriptive Statistics: Helps you understand how many customers left and their behaviors.
Inferential Statistics: Helps you predict churn trends and test which factors are statistically significant.
